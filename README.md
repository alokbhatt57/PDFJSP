The JSP application receives form input, stores the data in a MySQL database, and retrieves it using JDBC. It then uses the iTextPDF library to generate a PDF document based on the retrieved data. A connection to the MySQL database is established using a JDBC driver, and SQL queries (INSERT for saving form data, SELECT for retrieving it) handle the data. The iTextPDF library formats the data into a PDF structure, and the PDF is sent to the user as a downloadable file.
